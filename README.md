# Email tools

This repo contains dockerfiles and code I've used to create, manage and maintain my (sometimes) offline email setup work.

Beyond the standard, the tools I'm likely to use are:

* Docker
* [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org) and [Xapian](http://xapian.org/)
* mb2md
* Emacs + Orgmode :heart:
* Mutt
* Offline IMAP
