# CYA tools (Email, Google Drive, etc.)

This repo contains dockerfiles and code I've used for CYA.

What?  It helps backup, create, manage and maintain my (sometimes) offline email setup, Google Drive files, etc.

Beyond the standard, the tools I'm likely to use are:

All:
* Docker

Email:
* [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org) and [Xapian](http://xapian.org/)
* mb2md
* Emacs + Orgmode :heart:
* Mutt
* Offline IMAP

Google drive:
* [Google drive client](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive)
